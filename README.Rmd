<!-- badges: start -->
Our framework, **R** **I**mplementation of a **T**ransgenerational **H**ologenomic **M**odel-based **S**imulator (RITHMS) is an open-source package, builds upon the MoBPS package and incorporates the distinctive architecture of the microbiota, notably vertical and horizontal transfer as well as modulation due to the environment and host genetics. In addition, RITHMS can account for a variety of selection strategies, is adaptable to different genetic architectures.

Here is a little summary of how RITHMS work, but you can read the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07366) for more details.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RITHMS from GitHub using `devtools` with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SolenePety/RITHMS")
```
  
## Toy dataset  
  
You already have a toy dataset, a subset from [DÃ©ru et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7538339/), there are **1845 species** and **780 individuals**, that show you the expected structure of input data : 
  
```{r data}
library(RITHMS)
datafile <- system.file("DeruPop.rds", package = "RITHMS")
ToyData <- readRDS(datafile)
```
