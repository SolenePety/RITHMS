<!-- badges: start -->
Our framework, **R** **I**mplementation of a **T**ransgenerational **H**ologenomic **M**odel-based **S**imulator (RITHMS) is an open-source package, builds upon the MoBPS package and incorporates the distinctive architecture of the microbiota, notably vertical and horizontal transfer as well as modulation due to the environment and host genetics. In addition, RITHMS can account for a variety of selection strategies, is adaptable to different genetic architectures.

Here is a little summary of how RITHMS work, but you can read the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07366) for more details.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RITHMS from GitHub using `remotes` as shown below.

```{r install, eval=FALSE}

# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("SolenePety/RITHMS")
```

## Toy dataset  
  
You already have a toy dataset, a subset from [Déru et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7538339/), there are **1845 species** and **780 individuals**, that show you the expected structure of input data : 
  
```{r data}
library(RITHMS)
data("Deru")
ToyData <- Deru
```
  
To import your own dataset, you can refer to the following [vignette](https://solenepety.github.io/RITHMS/articles/import-data.html).

## Quick Start from the toy dataset

```{r start-toydata, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
taxa_assign_g <- assign_taxa(ToyData)
generations_simu <- holo_simu(h2 = 0.25,
                              b2 = 0.25,
                              founder_object = ToyData,
                              n_clust = taxa_assign_g,
                              n_ind = 500)
```


## Quick Start from your own dataset 

If you're using your own dataset instead of the toy dataset, make sure to calibrate the simulation parameters accordingly. In particular, the `n_ind` (number of individuals in each generation), the genetic effect size `effect.size` and the multinomial sampling size parameter `size_rmultinom` used in holo_simu() should be consistent with the characteristics of your dataset.

To help you with this, please refer to the [dedicated vignette](https://solenepety.github.io/RITHMS/articles/calibrate-simulation-parameters.html).

```{r start-pedmap, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# from VCf format
founder_object <- read_input_data(path_to_microbiome = "/path/to/microbiome.txt",
                                  path_to_pedmap = "/path/to/vcf/'prefix'",
                                  biome_id_column = "ind_id")
# from Ped/Map format
founder_object <- read_input_data(path_to_microbiome = "/path/to/microbiome.txt",
                                  path_to_pedmap = "/path/to/pedmap/'prefix'",
                                  biome_id_column = "ind_id")

taxa_assign_g <- assign_taxa(founder_object)
generations_simu <- holo_simu(h2 = 0.25,
                              b2 = 0.25, 
                              founder_object = founder_object,
                              n_clust = taxa_assign_g,
                              n_ind = 500,
                              effect.size = 0.3,
                              size_rmultinom = 10000)
# Choose n_ind, effect.size and size_rmultinom such that it is consistent with the initial dimensions of your data set
```
