Description: RITHMS, an R Implementation of a Transgenerational
    Hologenomic Model-based Simulator is an open-source package, builds
    upon the MoBPS package and incorporates the distinctive architecture
    of the microbiota, notably vertical and horizontal transfer as well as
    modulation due to the environment and host genetics.
